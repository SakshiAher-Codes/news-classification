# 📰 News Classification using NLP

## 📖 Description
Implemented a text classification model using Naive Bayes to categorize news articles into topics. Applied natural language processing techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK / spaCy  

## 🚀 Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)  
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction  
- Trained Naive Bayes classifier  
- Evaluated model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

## 📊 Results
- Naive Bayes Accuracy: ~90%  
- Identified top keywords influencing classification  

## 🖼️ Sample Output
